# Preprocessing

We will now preprocess our raw data which will reduce noise from non-biological signal as well as filter out low quality cells. Part of the preprocessing stage is also tranforming the data such as log-normalizing or scaling data to a given distribution. This will help give more meaningful results and help remove outliers. These will all be explained in this section.
